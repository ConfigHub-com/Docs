Create an Organization
**********************

Organizations are a better way to share management responsibilities for your repositories.
Some aspects of repository management are limited to repository owners, or admins - for example,
deleting tokens, changing repository settings, adding/removing team members as well as access
permissions.

To distribute this workload, organization let's you assign repository owners and administrators.

To create an organization, once logged in:

#. Click on the **New** link (top-right) and choose *Organization*
#. Enter the Organization name, and save.

Once the organization is created, you can create repositories and add users as owners and administrators.
