Welcome to ConfigHub documentation
==================================

What is ConfigHub?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ConfigHub is a platform for software configuration.  Configuration is managed
programmatically or through the Web-based user interface.

ConfigHub lets you assign users to teams, manage access to configuration, maintain security for sensitive
data and tag your configuration to correspond to your software release versions.

Integrate with ConfigHub - development becomes more fluid, mundane tasks are eliminated, and new ways of
leveraging and thinking about configuration will emerge.
